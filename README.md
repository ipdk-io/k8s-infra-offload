## Overview

Kubernetes* (k8s) is an open-source container orchestration system for
automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
Kubernetes uses a Container Network Interface (CNI) for setting up pod
connectivity, network policies for isolating pod traffic, and KubeProxy for
service load balancing.

The Kubernetes Infrastructure Offload project uses CNI P4 data-plane plugin
components that help offload the networking rules from Calico* CNI to P4
target devices. End users can then use this k8s-infra-offload software to
deploy their orchestration software.

This readme describes the components of Kubernetes Infrastructure Offload
software and how to install and set up these components.

## Motivation for Offload
The Kubernetes architecture requires Kubernetes networking for connectivity
of the pods within and outside the cluster be delegated to the CNI. For this,
on each worker node, Kubelet works with the co-located CNI to configure and
assign interfaces to the pods created on that worker node. In addition, the
Kube-proxy on each worker node interacts with Kubernetes control plane to
provide support for Services. Without any offloads, both CNI and kube-proxy
typically depend upon Linux kernel to provide these networking and service
support. These include routing of traffic to/from the pods, applying network
policies (filtering) on the traffic being sent/received by the pods, load
balancing and NAT operations on traffic flows belonging to Services, etc.

![Kubernetes Architecture](docs/images/Kube-Arch.png "Kubernetes
Worker Node Architecture Without Any Offloads")

Management of these configurations and all the required packet procesing,
requires significant CPU core utilization on the worker node. That takes away
significant amount of CPU cycles which could have been used for running the
actual application workload.

Additionally, this typical deployment model may not provide desired isolation
between the service provider components and the tenent's application workload.

The K8s-infra-offload software resolves both above deficiencies. That is, it
provides means to offload the packet processing to P4 pipeline as well as, it
allows the CNI and Kube-proxy configurations to be applied from outside the
worker node CPU cores.

For the P4 pipeline based packet processing, it defines and provides target
specific P4 pipeline as part of the K8s-Infra-Offload package. This includes
P4-DPDK target specific P4 pipeline.

For configuration aspects, it interacts with CNI plugin and Kubernetes API
server over secure gRPC channels. This allows the CNI configuration to be
managed from a different CPU complex.

## General Requirements
- For Infra Agent and Infra Manager to work, Kernel 5.4 or greater is required.
- The recommended OS to use is Fedora 33
- The recommended Kubernetes version to use is 1.25.0.
- You must not modify the P4 data plane program (`k8s_dp.p4`) and the
  configuration file (`k8s_dp.conf`), as the Kubernetes
  control plane software is tightly coupled with the pipeline. The artifacts
  generated by the P4 Compiler are available in the container and must
  be used as is.
- TAP interfaces should be created and available on the host system before
  Infra Agent is deployed. The default prefix for TAP interfaces names, as
  required by InfraAgent, is "P4TAP_".
- The number of TAP interfaces created must be a power of 2 and more than 4.
  For example, it can be 8, 16, 32 and so on.
- If a firewall is enabled in the host OS, you should either disable or
  configure it to allow required traffic to flow through.
- Many steps contained in this README require root permissions, especially the
  ones that install Kubernetes and related software and configure system files.
  Even though many steps can be carried out as a nonroot user, we recommend
  you run all the steps as root to avoid any confusion.

## Kubernetes Infrastructure Offload Components

The following are the main components of Kubernetes Infrastructure Offload
software.

### Kubernetes Infra Manager
- The Infra Manager is deployed as a core kube-system pod along with other
  kube-system pods.
- This components acts as a gRPC server for Kubernetes Infra Agent and receives
  Kubernetes configurations from the Infra Agent over the gRPC channel.
- It acts as a client for the P4 Runtime Server (infrap4d) and updates the
  Kubernetes Pipeline tables (Data Plane), over another gRPC channel, to apply
  Kubernetes configurations.

### Kubernetes Infra Agent
- The Infra Agent is also deployed as a core kube-system pod along with other
  kube-system pods.
- It receives all CNI requests from the Calico plug-in, configures pod system
  files, and adds interfaces to be pods. And finally, it relays these
  configurations to the Infra Manager.
- It also acts as a Kubernetes client for the Kubernetes API server and receives
  all configuration changes and passes them on to the Infra Manager component.
- It interacts with Infra Manager over the gRPC channel to pass all the
  configurations.

### Kubernetes ARP Proxy
- This process runs standalone within a separate and isolated namespace with
  one interface assigned to that namespace having a common gateway IP address.
- As the name suggests, it responds to ARP requests sent by the pods, seeking
  the MAC address of the common gateway. It responds with its interface's MAC
  address.

### Kubernetes P4 Pipeline
- The Kubernetes P4 pipeline is a prebuilt component that can be loaded on
  the P4-DPDK pipeline (i.e., P4 data plane).
- It comes along with the source P4 code for a user to understand the packet
  processing pipeline.
- It exposes P4 tables that can be modified at runtime with packet processing
  rules. These rules are for managing packet forwarding.

### Directories

- arp-proxy: Contains source code for the ARP Proxy
- bin: Contains all the binaries of the executables created by the Makefile
- deploy: Contains all the YAML files for deploying Kubernetes components
- example: Contains example YAML files to deploy test pods, etc.
- hack: Contains scripts for CI/CD
- images: Contains the Dockerfiles for Infra Agent and Infra Manager
- infraagent: Contains the source Go code of Infra Agent
- inframanager: Contains the source Go code of Infra Manager
- k8s_dp: Contains the P4 source code and the prebuilt P4 pipeline
- pkg: Contains all the supporting Go source code for Infra Manager and
  Infra Agent.
- proto: Contains all the protobuf files for gRPC messaging and the
  corresponding Go code.
- scripts: Contains all the setup scripts

### Debugging

- The Kubernetes Infrastructure Offload software provides logging capabilities.
  The logs are dumped in a temporary log file (`/var/log/inframanager.log`).
  You can inspect these logs using kubectl.

### Setup Scripts

- The script `./script/create_interfaces.sh` sets up HugePages required by
  DPDK and launches infrap4d (P4 OVS/SDE).

- The script `arp_proxy.sh` creates a separate namespace for the ARP proxy,
  assigns an interface to it, and then launches the ARP proxy within the
  isolated namespace.


## Installation, Setup, and Deployment

### Installing Kubernetes
Kubernetes Infra Offload requires Kubernetes, docker and containerd to be
installed. The instructions on how to install these pre-requires, follow
[Kubernetes, Docker, Containerd Installation](docs/k8s-docker-containerd-install.md).
If these components are already installed on the machine, proceed to next step.

### Install IPDK Networking Recipe
Kubernetes Infra Offload deployment depends upon the daemon infrap4d of IPDK
networking recipe to be running in the background. Once infrap4d is running,
kubernetes can load its P4 pipeline and offload various functionalities on it
i.e. on P4 data plane. Note that, IPDK infrap4d needs to installed and run on
the host natively. To install infrap4d and P4-SDE (components as per IPDK 23.01
release) individually, follow the instructions listed below. Note that, P4C is
not required as this software includes P4C generated artifacts.
 
#### P4-SDE
  To install P4-SDE, follow instructions at https://github.com/p4lang/p4-dpdk-target.
  Make sure to checkout SHA:199d418f5fcfaca7fb7992d4867e72b39ebe6e31 from the
  main branch. User can also refer to README.md for instructions. The main steps
  can be summerized as:

  Clone SDE repository, create install directory, setup environment variable and
  then build
  ```bash
  # git clone https://github.com/p4lang/p4-dpdk-target
  # mkdir install
  # export SDE=$PWD
  # cd p4-dpdk-target
  # git checkout 199d418f5fcfaca7fb7992d4867e72b39ebe6e31
  # git submodule update --init --recursive --force
  # cd ./tools/setup
  # source p4sde_env_setup.sh $SDE
  # cd $SDE/p4-dpdk-target
  # ./build-p4sde.sh -s $SDE_INSTALL
  ```

#### Infrap4d
  To install infrap4d, follow instructions as per the ipdk-dpdk link
  https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe/blob/ipdk_v23.01/docs/ipdk-dpdk.md.
  Note that, for the networking recipe, check out the tip of the ipdk_v23.01
  branch. The main steps can be summarized as:
  ```bash
  # git clone https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe.git ipdk.recipe
  # cd ipdk.recipe
  # git checkout ipdk_v23.01
  # git submodule update --init --recursive
  # export IPDK_RECIPE=$PWD
  # mkdir DEP_LIB
  # export DEPEND_INSTALL=$PWD/DEP_LIB
  # cd $IPDK_RECIPE/setup
  # cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$DEPEND_INSTALL
  # cmake --build build [-j<njobs>]

  # cd $IPDK_RECIPE
  # source ./scripts/dpdk/setup_env.sh $IPDK_RECIPE $SDE_INSTALL $DEPEND_INSTALL
  # ./make-all.sh --target=dpdk
  # ./scripts/dpdk/copy_config_files.sh $IPDK_RECIPE $SDE_INSTALL
  ```

### Setup P4-K8S
  Install Go package (go version go1.19.4 linux/amd64), following instruction
  at https://go.dev/doc/install
 
  Pull P4-K8s and other software
  ```bash
  # git clone https://github.com/ipdk-io/k8s-infra-offload.git p4-k8s
  # cd p4-k8s
  # git checkout ipdk_v23.01
  ```

  Build p4-k8s images and other binaries as below
  ```bash
  # make build
  # make docker-build
  ```

  Push InfraManager and InfraAgent images into docker private repo either
  manually or through make command.

  Either
  ```bash
  # make docker-push
  ```
  Or
  ```bash
  # docker push localhost:5000/infraagent:latest
  # docker push localhost:5000/inframanager:latest
  ```

  The docker images should now be listed in the local repository as below.
  ```bash
  # docker images
  REPOSITORY                             TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
  localhost:5000/inframanager            latest        7605ed47e042   5 minutes ago   22.1MB
  <none>                                 <none>        485d7bc6ec38   5 minutes ago   1.38GB
  localhost:5000/infraagent              latest        500075b89922   6 minutes ago   68.7MB
  <none>                                 <none>        dc519d06de56   6 minutes ago   1.68GB
  ...
  ```

  Pull images for use by Kubernetes CRI
  ```bash
  # crictl pull localhost:5000/inframanager:latest
  # crictl pull localhost:5000/infraagent:latest
  ```
 
### Deploy P4-K8s
  Generate the certificates required for mTLS connection between infraagent,
  inframanager and infrap4d
  ```bash
  # make gen-certs
  ```

  Run create_interfaces.sh script which, in addition to creating specified
  number of TAP interfaces, sets up the huge pages and starts infrap4d.
  Scripts requires following env variables to be set - SDE_INSTALL,
  IPDK_RECIPE, DEPEND_INSTALL. These env variables are defined in
  networking-recipe/main/docs/ipdk-dpdk.md

  ```bash
  # ./scripts/create_interfaces.sh <8/16/32/...>
  ```

  After running the above script, verify that infrap4d is running.
  ```bash
  # ps -ef | grep infrap4d
  root     1254701       1 99 13:34 ?        00:13:10 /host/networking-recipe/install/sbin/infrap4d
  ```

  Run ARP-Proxy script, which would create a new namespace, assign first tap
  interface i.e. P4TAP_0 to it, and finally run the arp-proxy on that interface.
  ```bash
  ./scripts/arp_proxy.sh
  ```

  Initialize and start the core k8s components as below
  ```bash
  # kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=<pod-cidr> --service-cidr=<service-cidr>
  ```

  Once K8s control plane initialization is complete successfully, then (as
  non-root user)
  ```bash
  # mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  # cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  # chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
  ```
  Or (as root user)
  ```bash
  # export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
  ```

  Start the deployments
  Note that, for single node deployment, the node must be untainted to allow
  worker pods to share the node with control plane. This can be done as below.
  ```bash
  # kubectl taint node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane-
  ```
  Create k8s secrets from the generated certificates. The infraagent and the
  manager reads the certificates from the secrets.

  ```bash
  make tls-secrets
  ```

  Start the deployment.
  ```bash
  # make deploy
  # make deploy-calico

  Check deployment using the command below.
  # kubectl get pods -A -o wide
  ```

### Pod-to-Pod Ping
  To run a simple ping test from one pod to another, create two test pods. Note
  that, the yaml file in the package is to create a single test pod and so, copy
  and modify it to create pod with different name. For example, copy it as
  test-pod2.yaml and change the metadata name and container name to be test-pod2.
  The .yaml file for test-pod2 should look as below.
  ```bash
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: test-pod2
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: test-pod2
      image: quay.io/quay/busybox:latest
      ...
  ```
  Now, create both the test pods
  ```bash
  # kubectl create -f example/test_pod.yaml
  # kubectl create -f example/test_pod2.yaml
  ```

  Check that the two test pods are ready and running.
  ```bash
  # kubectl get pods -o wide
  NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP               NODE    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
  test-pod    1/1     Running   0          10m    10.244.0.6       ins21   <none>           <none>
  test-pod2   1/1     Running   0          9m33s  10.244.0.7       ins21   <none>           <none>
  ```

  Get the IP address assigned to one of the pods using ifconfig. Then, ping that
  address from the other pod.
  ```bash
  # kubectl exec test-pod2 -- ifconfig eth0
  # kubectl exec test-pod -- ping 10.244.0.6
  PING 10.244.0.6 (10.244.0.6): 56 data bytes
  64 bytes from 10.244.0.6: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.112 ms
  64 bytes from 10.244.0.6: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.098 ms
  64 bytes from 10.244.0.6: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.102 ms
  64 bytes from 10.244.0.6: seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.112 ms
  ...
  ```

  To delete above created test pods
  ```bash
  # kubectl delete pod test-pod test-pod2
  ```

### Service Deployment
  To test simple service deployment, user can use iperf based server available
  in https://github.com/Pharb/kubernetes-iperf3.git repository. Clone this
  repository and deploy the service as below:
  ```bash
  # git clone https://github.com/Pharb/kubernetes-iperf3.git
  # cd kubernetes-iperf3
  # ./steps/setup.sh
  # kubectl get svc -A -o wide
  NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE     SELECTOR

  kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    15m     <none>
 
  # kubectl get ep -A -o wide
  NAMESPACE     NAME            ENDPOINTS                                               AGE

  ...
  ```
  To test service traffic, iperf3 client can be started as below:
  ```bash
  # cd kubernetes-iperf3
  # ./steps/run.sh

  The iperf3 client can also be executed manually inside the iperf client pod
  # kubectl exec --stdin --tty <iperf3-clients-xxx> -- /bin/bash
  # iperf3 -c iperf3-server
  Connecting to host iperf3-server, port 5201

  [  5]   1.00-2.00   sec  0.00 Bytes  0.00 bits/sec    1   1.41 KBytes
  ```
  To clean up above created services
  ```bash
  # ./steps/cleanup.sh
  ```

### Clean Up All
  Reset kubernetes which would stop and remove all pods. Then, remove all k8s
  runtime configurations and other files.
  ```bash
  Delete all started pods, service deployments and daemonsets
  # kubectl delete pod < >
  # kubectl delete deployment < >
  # make undeploy
  # make undeploy-calico
  # kubeadm reset -f
  # rm -rf /etc/cni /etc/kubernetes
  # rm -rf /var/lib/etcd /var/lib/kubelet /var/lib/cni
  # rm -rf /var/run/kubernetes
  # rm -rf $HOME/.kube
  # docker container stop registry && docker container rm -v registry
  Stop the system services
  # systemctl stop containerd
  ```

  Stop the ARP proxy and infrap4d processes running. This will also remove all
  the TAP interfaces that were configured earlier.
  ```bash
  # pkill arp_proxy
  # pkill infrap4d
  ```
